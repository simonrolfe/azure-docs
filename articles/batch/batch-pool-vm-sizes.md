# Choose a VM size for compute nodes in an Azure Batch pool

When you select a node size for an Azure Batch pool, you can choose from among almost all the VM sizes available in Azure. Azure offers a range of sizes for Linux and Windows VMs for different workloads. 

There are a few exceptions and limitations to choosing a VM size:
* Some VM families or VM sizes are not supported in Batch. 
* Some VM sizes are restricted and need to be specifically enabled before they can be allocated.


## Supported VM families and sizes

### Pools in Virtual Machine configuration

Batch pools in the Virtual Machine configuration support all VM sizes ([Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/sizes.md), [Windows](../virtual-machines/windows/sizes.md)) *except* for the following:

| Family  | Unsupported sizes  |
|---------|---------|
| Basic A-series | Basic_A0 (A0) |
| A-series | Standard_A0 |
| B-series | All |
| Fsv2-series<sup>*</sup> | All |

<sup>*</sup>Sizes in this series are on the roadmap for future support.

### Pools in Cloud Service configuration

Batch pools in the Cloud Service configuration support all [VM sizes for Cloud Services](../cloud-services/cloud-services-sizes-specs.md) *except* for the following:

| Family  | Unsupported sizes  |
|---------|---------|
| A-series | ExtraSmall |
| Av2-series | Standard_A1_v2, Standard_A2_v2, Standard_A2m_v2 |

## Restricted VM families
The following VM families can be allocated in Batch pools, but you must request a specific quota increase (see [this article](batch-quota-limit.md#increase-a-quota)):
* NCv2-series
* NCv3-series
* ND-series

These sizes can only be used in pools in the Virtual Machine configuration.

## Size considerations

* **Application requirements** - Consider the characteristics and requirements of the application you'll run on the nodes. Aspects like whether the application is multithreaded and how much memory it consumes can help determine the most suitable and cost-effective node size. For multi-instance [MPI workloads](batch-mpi.md) or CUDA applications, consider specialized [HPC](../virtual-machines/linux/sizes-hpc.md) or [GPU-enabled](../virtual-machines/linux/sizes-gpu.md) VM sizes, respectively. (See [Use RDMA-capable or GPU-enabled instances in Batch pools](batch-pool-compute-intensive-sizes.md).) 

* **Tasks per node** - It's typical to select a node size assuming one task runs on a node at a time. However, it might be advantageous to have multiple tasks (and therefore multiple application instances) [run in parallel](batch-parallel-node-tasks.md) on compute nodes during job execution. In this case, it is common to choose a multicore node size to accommodate the increased demand of parallel task execution.

* **Load levels for different tasks** - All of the nodes in a pool are the same size. If you intend to run applications with differing system requirements and/or load levels, we recommend that you use separate pools. 

* **Region availability** - A VM family or size might not be available in the regions where you create your Batch accounts. To check that a size is available, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/).

* **Quotas** - The [cores quotas](batch-quota-limit.md#resource-quotas) in your Batch account can limit the number of nodes of a given size you can add to a Batch pool. To request a quota increase, see [this article](batch-quota-limit.md#increase-a-quota). 

* **Pool configuration** - In general, you have more VM size options when you create a pool in the Virtual Machine configuration, compared with the Cloud Service configuration.
