# Update the MySQL resource provider 
A new SQL resource provider adapter might be released when Azure Stack builds are updated. While the existing adapter continues to work, we recommend updating to the latest build as soon as possible. Updates must be installed in order: you cannot skip versions

## Update the MySQL resource provider adapter (integrated systems only)
A new SQL resource provider adapter might be released when Azure Stack builds are updated. While the existing adapter continues to work, we recommend updating to the latest build as soon as possible.  
 
To update of the resource provider you use the **UpdateMySQLProvider.ps1** script. The process is similar to the process used to install a resource provider, as described in the [Deploy the resource provider](#deploy-the-resource-provider) section of this article. The script is included with the download of the resource provider. 

The **UpdateMySQLProvider.ps1** script creates a new VM with the latest resource provider code and migrates the settings from the old VM to the new VM. The settings that migrate include database and hosting server information, and the necessary DNS record. 

The script requires use of the same arguments that are described for the DeployMySqlProvider.ps1 script. Provide the certificate here as well.  

Following is an example of the *UpdateMySQLProvider.ps1* script that you can run from the PowerShell prompt. Be sure to change the account information and passwords as needed:  

> [!NOTE] 
> The update process only applies to integrated systems. 

```powershell 
# Install the AzureRM.Bootstrapper module and set the profile. 
Install-Module -Name AzureRm.BootStrapper -Force 
Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2017-03-09-profile 

# Use the NetBIOS name for the Azure Stack domain. On the Azure Stack SDK, the default is AzureStack but could have been changed at install time. 
$domain = "AzureStack" 

# For integrated systems, use the IP address of one of the ERCS virtual machines 
$privilegedEndpoint = "AzS-ERCS01" 

# Point to the directory where the resource provider installation files were extracted. 
$tempDir = 'C:\TEMP\MYSQLRP' 

# The service admin account (can be Azure Active Directory or Active Directory Federation Services). 
$serviceAdmin = "admin@mydomain.onmicrosoft.com" 
$AdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force 
$AdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($serviceAdmin, $AdminPass) 
 
# Set credentials for the new resource provider VM. 
$vmLocalAdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force 
$vmLocalAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("sqlrpadmin", $vmLocalAdminPass) 
 
# And the cloudadmin credential required for privileged endpoint access. 
$CloudAdminPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force 
$CloudAdminCreds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("$domain\cloudadmin", $CloudAdminPass) 

# Change the following as appropriate. 
$PfxPass = ConvertTo-SecureString "P@ssw0rd1" -AsPlainText -Force 
 
# Change directory to the folder where you extracted the installation files. 
# Then adjust the endpoints. 
$tempDir\UpdateMySQLProvider.ps1 -AzCredential $AdminCreds ` 
-VMLocalCredential $vmLocalAdminCreds ` 
-CloudAdminCredential $cloudAdminCreds ` 
-PrivilegedEndpoint $privilegedEndpoint ` 
-DefaultSSLCertificatePassword $PfxPass ` 
-DependencyFilesLocalPath $tempDir\cert ` 
-AcceptLicense 
```
