# Add an App Service resource provider to Azure Stack

*Applies to: Azure Stack integrated systems and Azure Stack Development Kit*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Apply the 1804 update to your Azure Stack integrated system or deploy the latest Azure Stack development kit before deploying Azure App Service 1.2.
>
>

As an Azure Stack cloud operator, you can give your users the ability to create web and API applications. To do this, you must first add the [App Service resource provider](azure-stack-app-service-overview.md) to your Azure Stack deployment as described in this article. After you have installed the App Service resource provider, you can include it in your offers and plans. Users can then subscribe to get the service and start creating applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prior to running the installer, make sure that you have followed the guidance in [Before you get started](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md).
>
>

## Run the App Service resource provider installer

Installing the App Service resource provider into your Azure Stack environment can take at least an hour dependent on how many role instances you chose to deploy. During this process, the installer will:

* Create a blob container in the specified Azure Stack storage account.
* Create a DNS zone and entries for App Service.
* Register the App Service resource provider.
* Register the App Service gallery items.

To deploy App Service resource provider, follow these steps:

1. Run appservice.exe as an administrator from a pc that can reach the Azure Stack Admin Azure Resource Management Endpoint.

2. Click **Deploy App Service or upgrade to the latest version**.

    ![App Service Installer][1]

3. Review and accept the Microsoft Software License Terms and then click **Next**.

4. Review and accept the third-party license terms and then click **Next**.

5. Make sure that the App Service cloud configuration information is correct. If you used the default settings during Azure Stack Development Kit deployment, you can accept the default values here. However, if you customized the options when you deployed Azure Stack, or are deploying on an integrated system, you must edit the values in this window to reflect that. For example, if you use the domain suffix mycloud.com, your Azure Stack Tenant Azure Resource Manager endpoint must change to management.&lt;region&gt;.mycloud.com. After you confirm your information, click **Next**.

    ![App Service Installer][2]

6. On the next page:
    1. Click the **Connect** button next to the **Azure Stack Subscriptions** box.
        * If you're using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), enter the Azure AD admin account and password that you provided when you deployed Azure Stack. Click **Sign In**.
        * If you're using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), provide your admin account. For example, cloudadmin@azurestack.local. Enter your password, and click **Sign In**.
    2. In the **Azure Stack Subscriptions** box, select the **Default Provider Subscription**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > App Service can only be deployed into the **Default Provider Subscription** at this time.  In a future update App Service will deploy into the new Metering Subscription introduced in Azure Stack 1804 and all existing deployments will be migrated to this new subscription also.
    >
    >
    
    3. In the **Azure Stack Locations** box, select the location that corresponds to the region you're deploying to. For example, select **local** if your deploying to the Azure Stack Development Kit.

    ![App Service Installer][3]

7. You now have the option to deploy into an existing Virtual Network as configured through the steps [here](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md#virtual-network), or allow the App Service installer to create a Virtual Network and associated Subnets.
    1. Select **Create VNet with default settings**, accept the defaults and click **Next**, or;
    2. Select **Use existing VNet and Subnets**.
        1. Select the **Resource Group** that contains your Virtual Network;
        2. Choose the correct **Virtual Network** name you wish to deploy into;
        3. Select the correct **Subnet** values for each of the required role subnets;
        4. Click **Next**

    ![App Service Installer][4]

8. Enter the information for your file share and then click **Next**. The address of the file share must use the Fully Qualified Domain Name, or IP Address of your File Server. For example, \\\appservicefileserver.local.cloudapp.azurestack.external\websites, or \\\10.0.0.1\websites.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The installer attempts to test connectivity to the fileshare before proceeding.  However if you have chosen to deploy in an existing Virtual Network, the installer might not be able to connect to the fileshare and a warning is presented asking whether you want to continue.  Verify the fileshare information and continue if they are correct.

9. On the next page:
    1. In the **Identity Application ID** box, enter the GUID for the application you’re using for identity (from Azure AD).
    2. In the **Identity Application certificate file** box, enter (or browse to) the location of the certificate file.
    3. In the **Identity Application certificate password** box, enter the password for the certificate. This password is the one that you made note of when you used the script to create the certificates.
    4. In the **Azure Resource Manager root certificate file** box, enter (or browse to) the location of the certificate file.
    5. Click **Next**.

    ![App Service Installer][9]

10. For each of the three certificate file boxes, click **Browse** and navigate to the appropriate certificate file. You must provide the password for each certificate. These certificates are the ones that you created in the [Create required certificates step](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md#get-certificates). Click **Next** after entering all the information.

    | Box | Certificate file name example |
    | --- | --- |
    | **App Service default SSL certificate file** | \_.appservice.local.AzureStack.external.pfx |
    | **App Service API SSL certificate file** | api.appservice.local.AzureStack.external.pfx |
    | **App Service Publisher SSL certificate file** | ftp.appservice.local.AzureStack.external.pfx |

    If you used a different domain suffix when you created the certificates, your certificate file names don’t use *local.AzureStack.external*. Instead, use your custom domain information.

    ![App Service Installer][10]

11. Enter the SQL Server details for the server instance used to host the App Service resource provider databases and then click **Next**. The installer validates the SQL connection properties.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The installer attempts to test connectivity to the SQl Server before proceeding.  However if you have chosen to deploy in an existing Virtual Network, the installer might not be able to connect to the SQL Server and a warning is presented asking whether you want to continue.  Verify the SQL Server information and continue if they are correct.
    >

    ![App Service Installer][11]

12. Review the role instance and SKU options. The defaults populate with the minimum number of instances and the minimum SKU for each role in an ASDK Deployment. A summary of vCPU and memory requirements is provided to help plan your deployment. After you make your selections, click **Next**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For production deployments, following the guidance in [Capacity planning for Azure App Service server roles in Azure Stack](azure-stack-app-service-capacity-planning.md).
    >
    >

    | Role | Minimum instances | Minimum SKU | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Controller | 1 | Standard_A2 - (2 vCPU, 3584 MB) | Manages and maintains the health of the App Service cloud. |
    | Management | 1 | Standard_A2 - (2 vCPUs, 3584 MB) | Manages the App Service Azure Resource Manager and API endpoints, portal extensions (admin, tenant, Functions portal), and the data service. To support failover, increased the recommended instances to 2. |
    | Publisher | 1 | Standard_A1 - (1 vCPU, 1792 MB) | Publishes content via FTP and web deployment. |
    | FrontEnd | 1 | Standard_A1 - (1 vCPU, 1792 MB) | Routes requests to App Service applications. |
    | Shared Worker | 1 | Standard_A1 - (1 vCPU, 1792 MB) | Hosts web or API applications and Azure Functions apps. You might want to add more instances. As an operator, you can define your offering and choose any SKU tier. The tiers must have a minimum of one vCPU. |

    ![App Service Installer][13]

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Windows Server 2016 Core is not a supported platform image for use with Azure App Service on Azure Stack.  Do not use evaluation images for production deployments.**

13. In the **Select Platform Image** box, choose your deployment Windows Server 2016 virtual machine image from the images available in the compute resource provider for the App Service cloud. Click **Next**.

14. On the next page:
     1. Enter the Worker Role virtual machine administrator user name and password.
     2. Enter the Other Roles virtual machine administrator user name and password.
     3. Click **Next**.

    ![App Service Installer][15]    

15. On the summary page:
    1. Verify the selections you made. To make changes, use the **Previous** buttons to visit previous pages.
    2. If the configurations are correct, select the check box.
    3. To start the deployment, click **Next**.

    ![App Service Installer][16]

16. On the next page:
    1. Track the installation progress. App Service on Azure Stack takes about 60 minutes to deploy based on the default selections.
    2. After the installer successfully finishes, click **Exit**.

    ![App Service Installer][17]

## Validate the App Service on Azure Stack installation

1. In the Azure Stack admin portal, go to **Administration - App Service**.

2. In the overview under status, check to see that the **Status** shows **All roles are ready**.

    ![App Service Management](media/azure-stack-app-service-deploy/image12.png)
    
> [!NOTE]
> If you chose to deploy into an existing virtual network and a internal IP address to connect to your fileserver, you must add an outbound security rule, enabling SMB traffic between the worker subnet and the fileserver.  To do this, go to the WorkersNsg in the Admin Portal and add an outbound security rule with the following properties:
> * Source: Any
> * Source port range: *
> * Destination: IP Addresses
> * Destination IP address range: Range of IPs for your fileserver
> * Destination port range: 445
> * Protocol: TCP
> * Action: Allow
> * Priority: 700
> * Name: Outbound_Allow_SMB445

## Test drive App Service on Azure Stack

After you deploy and register the App Service resource provider, test it to make sure that users can deploy web and API apps.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to create an offer that has the Microsoft.Web namespace within the plan. Then you need to have a tenant subscription that subscribes to this offer. For more information, see [Create offer](azure-stack-create-offer.md) and [Create plan](azure-stack-create-plan.md).
>
You *must* have a tenant subscription to create applications that use App Service on Azure Stack. The only capabilities that a service admin can complete within the admin portal are related to the resource provider administration of App Service. These capabilities include adding capacity, configuring deployment sources, and adding Worker tiers and SKUs.
>
To create web, API, and Azure Functions apps, you must use the tenant portal and have a tenant subscription.

1. In the Azure Stack tenant portal, click **New** > **Web + Mobile** > **Web App**.

2. On the **Web App** blade, type a name in the **Web app** box.

3. Under **Resource Group**, click **New**. Type a name in the **Resource Group** box.

4. Click **App Service plan/Location** > **Create New**.

5. On the **App Service plan** blade, type a name in the **App Service plan** box.

6. Click **Pricing tier** > **Free-Shared** or **Shared-Shared** > **Select** > **OK** > **Create**.

7. In under a minute, a tile for the new web app appears on the dashboard. Click the tile.

8. On the **Web App** blade, click **Browse** to view the default website for this app.

## Deploy a WordPress, DNN, or Django website (optional)

1. In the Azure Stack tenant portal, click **+**, go to the Azure Marketplace, deploy a Django website, and wait for successful completion. The Django web platform uses a file system-based database. It doesn’t require any additional resource providers, such as SQL or MySQL.

2. If you also deployed a MySQL resource provider, you can deploy a WordPress website from the Marketplace. When you're prompted for database parameters, enter the user name as *User1@Server1*, with the user name and server name of your choice.

3. If you also deployed a SQL Server resource provider, you can deploy a DNN website from the Marketplace. When you're prompted for database parameters, choose a database in the computer running SQL Server that's connected to your resource provider.
