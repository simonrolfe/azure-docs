# Welcome to Azure Government
## Overview
Microsoft Azure Government delivers a cloud platform built upon the [foundational principles of security, privacy & control, compliance, and transparency](http://azure.com/gov). Public Sector entities receive a physically isolated instance of Microsoft Azure that employs world-class security and [compliance services](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/trust-center/compliance/) critical to U.S. government for all systems and applications built on its architecture. These services include FedRAMP and DoD compliance certifications, CJIS state-level agreements, the ability to issue HIPAA Business Associate Agreements, and support for IRS 1075. Operated by screened U.S. persons, Azure Government supports multiple hybrid scenarios for building and deploying solutions on-premises or in the cloud. Public Sector entities can also take advantage of the instant scalability and guaranteed uptime of a hyper-scale cloud service.

Azure Government includes the core components of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).  This includes infrastructure, network, storage, data management, identity management, and many other services.

Azure Government supports most of the same great features that public Azure customers have leveraged like Geo-Synchronous data replication and auto scaling.

## Azure Government Documentation
This site describes the capabilities of [Microsoft Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/gov/) services, and provides general guidance applicable to all customers. Before including specifically regulated data in your Azure Government subscription, you should familiarize yourself with the Azure Government capabilities and consult your account team if you have any questions.

You should refer to the [Microsoft Azure Trust Center Compliance Page](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/default.aspx) for current information on the Azure Government services covered under specific accreditations and regulations. Additional Microsoft services might also be available, but are not within the scope of the Azure Government covered services and are not addressed by this document. Azure Government services might also permit you to use various additional resources, applications, or services that are provided by third parties—or by Microsoft under separate terms of use and privacy policies—which are not included in the scope of this document. You are responsible for reviewing the terms of all such “add-on” offerings, such as Marketplace offerings, to ensure that they meet your needs regarding compliance.

Azure Government is available to entities that handle data that is subject to certain government regulations and requirements (such as NIST 800.171 (DIB), ITAR, IRS 1075, DoD L4, and CJIS) where use of Azure Government is required to comply with regulations. Azure Government customers are subject to validation of eligibility.

Entities with questions about eligibility for Azure Government should consult their account team.

## General Guidance for Customers
Most of the technical content that is available currently assumes that applications are being developed for the Global Service rather than for Microsoft Azure Government, it’s important for you to ensure that developers are aware of key differences for applications developed to be hosted in Azure Government.

* First, there are services and feature differences, this means that certain features that are in specific regions of the Global Service may not be available in Azure Government.
* Second, for features that are offered in Azure Government, there are configuration differences from the Global Service.  Therefore, you should review your sample code, configurations, and steps to ensure that you are building and executing within the Azure Government Cloud Services environment.
* Third, you should refer to the Azure Government Technical services documentation available from this site for information that identifies the Azure Government boundary and customer regulated/controlled data guidance and best practices.
