# Azure Government Security + Identity
## Key Vault

| Key Vault | \*.vault.azure.net | \*.vault.usgovcloudapi.net |
| Service Principal ID| cfa8b339-82a2-471a-a3c9-0fc0be7a4093 | 7e7c393b-45d0-48b1-a35e-2905ddf8183c | 
| Service Principal Name | Azure Key Vault | Azure Key Vault |

### Data Considerations

| --- | --- |
| All data encrypted with an Azure Key Vault key may contain Regulated/controlled data. |Azure Key Vault metadata is not permitted to contain export-controlled data. This metadata includes all configuration data entered when creating and maintaining your Key Vault.  Do not enter Regulated/controlled data into the following fields: **Resource group names, Key Vault names, Subscription name** |

## Azure Active Directory

| Service Type | Azure Public | Azure Government |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Active Directory Endpoint and Authority | https://login.microsoftonline.com | https://login.microsoftonline.us | 
| Active Directory Graph API| https://graph.windows.net/ | https://graph.windows.net/ |

## Azure Active Directory Premium P1 and P2 

Azure Active Directory Premium is available in Azure Government. For details on this service and how to use it, see the [Azure Active Directory Documentation](../active-directory/index.md).  

For a list of features in Azure Active Directory Premium P1, see [Azure Active Directory Features](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/azure-active-directory-features) for a list of all capabilities available. This same feature list applies to the US Government cloud instance. 
All features covered in the above list are available in the US Government cloud instance, with the following known limitations: 

### Variations 

The following Azure Active Directory Premium P1 features are currently not available in Azure Government: 

 - B2B Collaboration ([vote for this feature](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/558487-azure-government/suggestions/20588554-azure-ad-b2b-in-azure-government)) 
 - Group-Based Licensing 
 - Azure Active Directory Domain Services 
 - Intune enabled Conditional Access scenarios 
 - Cloud App Security 

The following features have known limitations in Azure Government: 

 - Limitations with the Azure Active Directory App Gallery: 
    - Pre-integrated SAML and password SSO applications from the Azure AD Application Gallery are not yet available. Instead, use a custom application to support federated single sign-on with SAML or password SSO. 
    - Rich provisioning connectors for featured apps are not yet available. Instead, use SCIM for automated provisioning. 

 - Limitations with Multi-factor Authentication: 
   - Oath tokens, SMS, and Voice verification can be used as factors, though SMS and Voice traverse outside the Azure Government Cloud.
   - Trusted IPs are not supported in Azure Government. Instead, use Conditional Access policies with named locations to establish when Multi-Factor Authentication should and should not be required based off the userâ€™s current IP address. 

 - Limitations with Azure AD Join: 
   - Joining cloud and hybrid devices to Azure AD is not yet available 
   - Features related to Azure AD joined devices not yet available are Desktop SSO, Windows Hello and Self-service BitLocker recovery
   - MDM auto-enrollment for Windows 10 devices in Azure AD is not yet available 
   - Enterprise State Roaming for Windows 10 devices is not available
