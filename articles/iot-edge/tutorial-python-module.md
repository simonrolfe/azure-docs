# Develop and deploy a Python IoT Edge module to your simulated device - preview

You can use IoT Edge modules to deploy code that implements your business logic directly to your IoT Edge devices. This tutorial walks you through creating and deploying an IoT Edge module that filters sensor data. You'll use the simulated IoT Edge device that you created in the Deploy Azure IoT Edge on a simulated device in [Windows][lnk-tutorial1-win] or [Linux][lnk-tutorial1-lin] tutorials. In this tutorial, you learn how to:    

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Use Visual Studio Code to create an IoT Edge Python module
> * Use Visual Studio Code and Docker to create a docker image and publish it to your registry 
> * Deploy the module to your IoT Edge device
> * View generated data


The IoT Edge module that you create in this tutorial filters the temperature data generated by your device. It only sends messages upstream if the temperature is above a specified threshold. This type of analysis at the edge is useful for reducing the amount of data communicated to and stored in the cloud. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently the Python module can only be run in amd64 Linux containers; it cannot run in Windows containers or ARM-based containers. 

## Prerequisites

* The Azure IoT Edge device that you created in the quickstart or first tutorial.
* The primary key connection string for the IoT Edge device.  
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
* [Azure IoT Edge extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-edge). 
* [Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). 
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on the same computer that has Visual Studio Code. The Community Edition (CE) is sufficient for this tutorial. 
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#installation) for installing Python packages (typically included with your Python installation).

## Create a container registry
In this tutorial, you use the Azure IoT Edge extension for VS Code to build a module and create a **container image** from the files. Then you push this image to a **registry** that stores and manages your images. Finally, you deploy your image from your registry to run on your IoT Edge device.  

You can use any Docker-compatible registry for this tutorial. Two popular Docker registry services available in the cloud are [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) and [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#viewing-repository-tags). This tutorial uses Azure Container Registry. 

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Create a resource** > **Containers** > **Azure Container Registry**.
2. Give your registry a name, choose a subscription, choose a resource group, and set the SKU to **Basic**. 
3. Select **Create**.
4. Once your container registry is created, navigate to it and select **Access keys**. 
5. Toggle **Admin user** to **Enable**.
6. Copy the values for **Login server**, **Username**, and **Password**. You'll use these values later in the tutorial. 

## Create an IoT Edge module project
The following steps show you how to create an IoT Edge Python module using Visual Studio Code and the Azure IoT Edge extension.
1. In Visual Studio Code, select **View** > **Integrated Terminal** to open the VS Code integrated terminal.
2. In the integrated terminal, enter the following command to install (or update) **cookiecutter** (we suggest doing this either into a virtual environment or as a user install as shown below):

    ```cmd/sh
    pip install --upgrade --user cookiecutter
    ```

3. Create a project for the new module. The following command creates the project folder, **FilterModule**, with your container repository. The parameter of `image_repository` should be in the form of `<your container registry name>.azurecr.io/filtermodule` if you are using Azure container registry. Enter the following command in the current working folder:

    ```cmd/sh
    cookiecutter --no-input https://github.com/Azure/cookiecutter-azure-iot-edge-module module_name=FilterModule image_repository=<your container registry address>/filtermodule
    ```
 
4. Select  **File** > **Open Folder**.
5. Browse to the **FilterModule** folder and click **Select Folder** to open the project in VS Code.
6. In VS Code explorer, click **main.py** to open it.
7. At the top of the **FilterModule** namespace, import the `json` library:

    ```python
    import json
    ```

8. Add the `TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD`, `RECEIVE_CALLBACKS`, and `TWIN_CALLBACKS` under the global counters. The temperature threshold sets the value that the measured temperature must exceed in order for the data to be sent to IoT Hub.

    ```python
    TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = 25
    TWIN_CALLBACKS = RECEIVE_CALLBACKS = 0
    ```

9. Update the function `receive_message_callback` with below content.

    ```python
    # receive_message_callback is invoked when an incoming message arrives on the specified 
    # input queue (in the case of this sample, "input1").  Because this is a filter module, 
    # we will forward this message onto the "output1" queue.
    def receive_message_callback(message, hubManager):
        global RECEIVE_CALLBACKS
        global TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD
        message_buffer = message.get_bytearray()
        size = len(message_buffer)
        message_text = message_buffer[:size].decode('utf-8')
        print("    Data: <<<{}>>> & Size={:d}".format(message_text, size))
        map_properties = message.properties()
        key_value_pair = map_properties.get_internals()
        print("    Properties: {}".format(key_value_pair))
        RECEIVE_CALLBACKS += 1
        print("    Total calls received: {:d}".format(RECEIVE_CALLBACKS))
        data = json.loads(message_text)
        if "machine" in data and "temperature" in data["machine"] and data["machine"]["temperature"] > TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD:
            map_properties.add("MessageType", "Alert")
            print("Machine temperature {} exceeds threshold {}".format(data["machine"]["temperature"], TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD))
        hubManager.forward_event_to_output("output1", message, 0)
        return IoTHubMessageDispositionResult.ACCEPTED
    ```

10. Add a new function `device_twin_callback`. This function will be invoked when the desired properties are updated.

    ```python
    # device_twin_callback is invoked when twin's desired properties are updated.
    def device_twin_callback(update_state, payload, user_context):
        global TWIN_CALLBACKS
        global TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD
        print("\nTwin callback called with:\nupdateStatus = {}\npayload = {}\ncontext = {}".format(update_state, payload, user_context))
        data = json.loads(payload)
        if "desired" in data and "TemperatureThreshold" in data["desired"]:
            TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = data["desired"]["TemperatureThreshold"]
        if "TemperatureThreshold" in data:
            TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = data["TemperatureThreshold"]
        TWIN_CALLBACKS += 1
        print("Total calls confirmed: {:d}\n".format(TWIN_CALLBACKS))
    ```

11. In class `HubManager`, add a new line to the `__init__` method to initialize the `device_twin_callback` function you just added.

    ```python
    # sets the callback when a twin's desired properties are updated.
    self.client.set_device_twin_callback(device_twin_callback, self)
    ```


12. Save this file.

## Create a Docker image and publish it to your registry

1. Sign in to Docker by entering the following command in the VS Code integrated terminal: 
     
   ```csh/sh
   docker login -u <username> -p <password> <Login server>
   ```
        
   Use the user name, password, and login server that you copied from your Azure container registry when you created it.

2. In VS Code explorer, Right-click the **module.json** file and click **Build and Push IoT Edge module Docker image**. In the pop-up dropdown box at the top of the VS Code window, select your container platform, for example, **amd64** for Linux container. VS Code containerize the `main.py` and required dependencies, then push it to the container registry you specified. It might take several minutes for your first time to build the image.

3. You can get the full container image address with tag in the VS Code integrated terminal. For more infomation about the build and push definition, you can refer to the `module.json` file.

## Add registry credentials to Edge runtime
Add the credentials for your registry to the Edge runtime on the computer where you are running your Edge device. These credentials give the runtime access to pull the container. 

- For Windows, run the following command:
    
    ```cmd/sh
    iotedgectl login --address <your container registry address> --username <username> --password <password> 
    ```

- For Linux, run the following command:
    
    ```cmd/sh
    sudo iotedgectl login --address <your container registry address> --username <username> --password <password> 
    ```

## Run the solution

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your IoT hub.
2. Go to **IoT Edge (preview)** and select your IoT Edge device.
3. Select **Set Modules**. 
2. Check that the **tempSensor** module is automatically populated. If it's not, use the following steps to add it:
    1. Select **Add IoT Edge Module**.
    2. In the **Name** field, enter `tempSensor`.
    3. In the **Image URI** field, enter `microsoft/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0-preview`.
    4. Leave the other settings unchanged and click **Save**.
9. Add the **filterModule** module that you created in the previous sections. 
    1. Select **Add IoT Edge Module**.
    2. In the **Name** field, enter `filterModule`.
    3. In the **Image URI** field, enter your image address; for example `<your container registry address>/filtermodule:0.0.1-amd64`. The full image address can be found from the previous section.
    4. Check the **Enable** box so that you can edit the module twin. 
    5. Replace the JSON in the text box for the module twin with the following JSON: 

        ```json
        {
           "properties.desired":{
              "TemperatureThreshold":25
           }
        }
        ```
 
    6. Click **Save**.
10. Click **Next**.
11. In the **Specify Routes** step, copy the JSON below into the text box. Modules publish all messages to the Edge runtime. Declarative rules in the runtime define where the messages flow. In this tutorial, you need two routes. The first route transports messages from the temperature sensor to the filter module via the "input1" endpoint, which is the endpoint that you configured with the  **FilterMessages** handler. The second route transports messages from the filter module to IoT Hub. In this route, `upstream` is a special destination that tells Edge Hub to send messages to IoT Hub. 

    ```json
    {
       "routes":{
          "sensorToFilter":"FROM /messages/modules/tempSensor/outputs/temperatureOutput INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/filterModule/inputs/input1\")",
          "filterToIoTHub":"FROM /messages/modules/filterModule/outputs/output1 INTO $upstream"
       }
    }
    ```

4. Click **Next**.
5. In the **Review Template** step, click **Submit**. 
6. Return to the IoT Edge device details page and click **Refresh**. You should see the new **filtermodule** running along with the **tempSensor** module and the **IoT Edge runtime**. 

## View generated data

To monitor device to cloud messages sent from your IoT Edge device to your IoT hub:
1. Configure the Azure IoT Toolkit extension with connection string for your IoT hub: 
    1. Open the VS Code explorer by selecting **View** > **Explorer**. 
    3. In the explorer, click **IOT HUB DEVICES** and then click **...**. Click **Set IoT Hub Connection String** and enter the connection string for the IoT hub that your IoT Edge device connects to in the pop-up window. 

        To find the connection string, click the tile for your IoT hub in the Azure portal and then click **Shared access policies**. In **Shared access policies**, click the **iothubowner** policy and copy the IoT Hub connection string in the **iothubowner** window.   

1. To monitor data arriving at the IoT hub, select **View** > **Command Palette** and search for the **IoT: Start monitoring D2C message** menu command. 
2. To stop monitoring data, use the **IoT: Stop monitoring D2C message** menu command. 

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an IoT Edge module that contains code to filter raw data generated by your IoT Edge device. You can continue on to either of the following tutorials to learn about other ways that Azure IoT Edge can help you turn data into business insights at the edge.
