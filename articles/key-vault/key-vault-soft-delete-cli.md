# How to use Key Vault soft-delete with CLI

Azure Key Vault's soft delete feature allows recovery of deleted vaults and vault objects. Specifically, soft-delete addresses the following scenarios:

- Support for recoverable deletion of a key vault
- Support for recoverable deletion of key vault objects; keys, secrets, and, certificates

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI 2.0 - If you don't have this setup for your environment, see [Manage Key Vault using CLI 2.0](key-vault-manage-with-cli2.md).

For Key Vault specific reference information for CLI, see [Azure CLI 2.0 Key Vault reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/keyvault).

## Required permissions

Key Vault operations are separately managed via role-based access control (RBAC) permissions as follows:

| Operation | Description | User permission |
|:--|:--|:--|
|List|Lists deleted key vaults.|Microsoft.KeyVault/deletedVaults/read|
|Recover|Restores a deleted key vault.|Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/write|
|Purge|Permanently removes a deleted key vault and all its contents.|Microsoft.KeyVault/locations/deletedVaults/purge/action|

For more information on permissions and access control, see [Secure your key vault](key-vault-secure-your-key-vault.md).

## Enabling soft-delete

To be able to recover a deleted key vault or objects stored in a key vault, you must first enable soft-delete for that key vault.

### Existing key vault

For an existing key vault named ContosoVault, enable soft-delete as follows. 

>[!NOTE]
>Currently you need to use Azure Resource Manager resource manipulation to directly write the *enableSoftDelete* property to the Key Vault resource.

```azurecli
az resource update --id $(az keyvault show --name ContosoVault -o tsv | awk '{print $1}') --set properties.enableSoftDelete=true
```

### New key vault

Enabling soft-delete for a new key vault is done at creation time by adding the soft-delete enable flag to your create command.

```azurecli
az keyvault create --name ContosoVault --resource-group ContosoRG --enable-soft-delete true --location westus
```

### Verify soft-delete enablement

To verify that a key vault has soft-delete enabled, run the *show* command and look for the 'Soft Delete Enabled?' attribute and its setting, true or false.

```azurecli
az keyvault show --name ContosoVault
```

## Deleting a key vault protected by soft-delete

The command to delete (or remove) a key vault remains the same, but its behavior changes depending on whether you have enabled soft-delete or not.

```azurecli
az keyvault delete --name ContosoVault
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>If you run the previous command for a key vault that does not have soft-delete enabled, you will permanently delete this key vault and all its content without any options for recovery.

### How soft-delete protects your key vaults

With soft-delete enabled:

- When a key vault is deleted, it is removed from its resource group and placed in a reserved namespace that is only associated with the location where it was created. 
- Objects in a deleted key vault, such as keys, secrets and, certificates, are inaccessible and remain so while their containing key vault is in the deleted state. 
- The DNS name for a key vault in a deleted state is still reserved so, a new key vault with same name cannot be created.Â  

You may view deleted state key vaults, associated with your subscription, using the following command:

```azurecli
az keyvault list-deleted
```

The *Resource ID* in the output refers to the original resource ID of this vault. Since this key vault is now in a deleted state, no resource exists with that resource ID. The *Id* field can be used to identify the resource when recovering, or purging. The *Scheduled Purge Date* field indicates when the vault will be permanently deleted (purged) if no action is taken for this deleted vault. The default retention period, used to calculate the *Scheduled Purge Date*, is 90 days.

## Recovering a key vault

To recover a key vault, you need to specify the key vault name, resource group, and location. Note the location and the resource group of the deleted key vault as you need these for a key vault recovery process.

```azurecli
az keyvault recover --location westus --name ContosoVault
```

When a key vault is recovered, the result is a new resource with the key vault's original resource ID. If the resource group where the key vault existed has been removed, a new resource group with same name must be created before the key vault can be recovered.

## Key Vault objects and soft-delete

For a key, 'ContosoFirstKey', in a key vault named 'ContosoVault' with soft-delete enabled, here's how you would delete that key.

```azurecli
az keyvault key delete --name ContosoFirstKey --vault-name ContosoVault
```

With your key vault enabled for soft-delete, a deleted key still appears like it's deleted except, when you explicitly list or retrieve deleted keys. Most operations on a key in the deleted state will fail except for listing a deleted key, recovering it or purging it. 

For example, to request to list deleted keys in a key vault, use the following command:

```azurecli
az keyvault key list-deleted --vault-name ContosoVault
```

### Transition state 

When you delete a key in a key vault with soft-delete enabled, it may take a few seconds for the transition to complete. During this transition state, it may appear that the key is not in the active state or the deleted state. This command will list all deleted keys in your key vault named 'ContosoVault'.

```azurecli
az keyvault key list-deleted --vault-name ContosoVault
```

### Using soft-delete with key vault objects

Just like key vaults, a deleted key, secret or, certificate will remain in deleted state for up to 90 days unless you recover it or purge it. 

#### Keys

To recover a deleted key:

```azurecli
az keyvault key recover --name ContosoFirstKey --vault-name ContosoVault
```

To permanently delete a key:

```azurecli
az keyvault key purge --name ContosoFirstKey --vault-name ContosoVault
```

>[!NOTE]
>Purging a key will permanently delete it, meaning it will not be recoverable.

The **recover** and **purge** actions have their own permissions associated in a key vault access policy. For a user or service principal to be able to execute a **recover** or **purge** action they must have the respective permission for that object (key or secret) in the key vault access policy. By default, the **purge** permission is not added to a key vault's access policy when the 'all' shortcut is used to grant all permissions to a user. You must explicitly grant **purge** permission. For example, the following command grants user@contoso.com permission to perform several operations on keys in *ContosoVault* including **purge**.

#### Set a key vault access policy

```azurecli
az keyvault set-policy --name ContosoVault --key-permissions get create delete list update import backup restore recover purge
```

>[!NOTE] 
> If you have an existing key vault that has just had soft-delete enabled, you may not have **recover** and **purge** permissions.

#### Secrets

Like keys, secrets in a key vault are operated on with their own commands. Following, are the commands for deleting, listing, recovering, and purging secrets.

- Delete a secret named SQLPassword: 
```azurecli
az keyvault secret delete --vault-name ContosoVault -name SQLPassword
```

- List all deleted secrets in a key vault: 
```azurecli
az keyvault secret list-deleted --vault-name ContosoVault
```

- Recover a secret in the deleted state: 
```azurecli
az keyvault secret recover --name SQLPassword --vault-name ContosoVault
```

- Purge a secret in deleted state: 
```azurecli
az keyvault secret purge --name SQLPAssword --vault-name ContosoVault
```

>[!NOTE]
>Purging a secret will permanently delete it, meaning it will not be recoverable.

## Purging and key vaults

### Key vault objects

Purging a key, secret or, certificate will permanently delete it, meaning it will not be recoverable. The key vault that contained the deleted object will however remain intact as will all other objects in the key vault. 

### Key vaults as containers
When a key vault is purged, all of its contents, including keys, secrets, and certificates, are permanently deleted. To purge a key vault, use the `az keyvault purge` command. You can find the location your subscription's deleted key vaults using the command `az keyvault list-deleted`.

```azurecli
az keyvault purge --location westus --name ContosoVault
```

>[!NOTE]
>Purging a key vault will permanently delete it, meaning it will not be recoverable.

### Purge permissions required
- To purge a deleted key vault, such that the vault and all its contents are permanently removed, the user needs RBAC permission to perform a *Microsoft.KeyVault/locations/deletedVaults/purge/action* operation. 
- To list the deleted key, the vault a user needs RBAC permission to perform *Microsoft.KeyVault/deletedVaults/read* permission. 
- By default only a subscription administrator has these permissions. 

### Scheduled purge

Listing your deleted key vault objects shows when they are schedled to be purged by Key Vault. The *Scheduled Purge Date* field indicates when a key vault object will be permanently deleted, if no action is taken. By default, the retention period for a deleted key vault object is 90 days.

>[!NOTE]
>A purged vault object, triggered by its *Scheduled Purge Date* field, is permanently deleted. It is not recoverable.
