This article will walk you through the steps to add, resize, and remove a virtual network (VNet) gateway for a pre-existing VNet. The steps for this configuration are specifically for VNets that were created using the **classic deployment model** and that will be be used in an ExpressRoute configuration.

## Before beginning
Verify that you have installed the Azure PowerShell cmdlets needed for this configuration (1.0.2 or later). If you haven't installed the cmdlets, you'll need to do so before beginning the configuration steps. For more information about installing Azure PowerShell, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview).

## Next steps
After you have created the VNet gateway, you can link your VNet to an ExpressRoute circuit. See [Link a Virtual Network to an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-classic.md).
