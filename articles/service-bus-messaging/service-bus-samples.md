# Service Bus messaging samples

The Service Bus messaging samples demonstrate key features in [Service Bus messaging](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/). Currently, you can find the samples in two places:

- [Service Bus messaging samples on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus/tree/master/samples/DotNet): a newer set of samples, hosted on GitHub. See the [readme file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-bus/blob/master/samples/DotNet/Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging/README.md) in the repo for descriptions of these .NET samples. The samples are continuously updated, so check back often for updates.
- [MSDN samples page](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?query=service%20bus&f%5B0%5D.Value=service%20bus&f%5B0%5D.Type=SearchText&ac=5): older samples that live in the MSDN code gallery. Although these samples still work, they are not maintained and may be outdated with respect to current recommended programming practices.
 
## Service Bus Explorer

In addition, the [Service Bus Explorer](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer) is a sample hosted on GitHub that enables you to connect to a Service Bus service namespace and easily manage messaging entities. The tool provides advanced features such as import/export functionality, and the ability to test messaging entities and relay services. You can find the full Service Bus Explorer source and documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/paolosalvatori/ServiceBusExplorer).
