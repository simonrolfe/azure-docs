# Azure Active Directory Proof of Concept Playbook: Introduction

This article provides guidelines to explore different Azure AD capabilities in a Proof of Concept (PoC). The intended audience of this document is Identity Architects, IT Professionals, and System Integrators

## How to use this Playbook

1. Use the [Theme](active-directory-playbook-ingredients.md#theme) section and pick the area(s) of interest based on your needs.  
2. Scope the PoC by choosing the scenarios that align with your business goals. The shorter the better. We recommend doing it as short and concise as possible to convey the value to the stakeholders while minimizing the complexity to realize it.  
3. Use the [Implementation](active-directory-playbook-implementation.md) section to understand the scenarios, and what would they mean for your environment. In each scenario, we describe how to set it up (what we call [Building Blocks](active-directory-playbook-building-blocks.md)), and how to navigate the scenarios. 
4. Each building block explains the pre-requisites needed, as well as an approximate time to complete. This can help you during the planning process. 
5. Based on 1-3 Above, define the [Environment](active-directory-playbook-ingredients.md#environment) in which to execute. We encourage to strive for a production environment to get a good feel of the experience for your users. 
6. When having conflicting requirements, use this helpful tradeoff matrix 
   * Theme-centric showing of value  
   * Smoothness to prepare, to set up, and to execute the scenarios 
   * Minimal time to execute the target scenarios 
   * As close to production as feasible within your constraints
