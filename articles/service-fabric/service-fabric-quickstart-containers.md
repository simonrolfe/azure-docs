# Quickstart: deploy a Service Fabric Windows container application on Azure
Azure Service Fabric is a distributed systems platform for deploying and managing scalable and reliable microservices and containers. 

Running an existing application in a Windows container on a Service Fabric cluster doesn't require any changes to your application. This quickstart shows you how to deploy a pre-built Docker container image in a Service Fabric application. When you're finished, you'll have a running Windows Server 2016 Nano Server and IIS container. This quickstart describes deploying a Windows container, read [this quickstart](service-fabric-quickstart-containers-linux.md) to deploy a Linux container.

In this quickstart you learn how to:

* Package a Docker image container
* Configure communication
* Build and package the Service Fabric application
* Deploy the container application to Azure

## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription (you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)).
* A development computer running:
  * Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017.
  * [Service Fabric SDK and tools](service-fabric-get-started.md).

## Package a Docker image container with Visual Studio
The Service Fabric SDK and tools provide a service template to help you deploy a container to a Service Fabric cluster.

Start Visual Studio as "Administrator".  Select **File** > **New** > **Project**.

Select **Service Fabric application**, name it "MyFirstContainer", and click **OK**.

Select **Container** from the **Hosted Containers and Applications** templates.

In **Image Name**, enter "microsoft/iis:nanoserver", the [Windows Server Nano Server and IIS base image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/iis/). 

Configure the container port-to-host port mapping so that incoming requests to the service on port 80 are mapped to port 80 on the container.  Set **Container Port** to "80" and set **Host Port** to "80".  

Name your service "MyContainerService", and click **OK**.

## Specify the OS build for your container image
Containers built with a specific version of Windows Server may not run on a host running a different version of Windows Server. For example, containers built using Windows Server version 1709 do not run on hosts running Windows Server 2016. To learn more, see [Windows Server container OS and host OS compatibility](service-fabric-get-started-containers.md#windows-server-container-os-and-host-os-compatibility). 

With version 6.1 of the Service Fabric runtime and newer, you can specify multiple OS images per container and tag each with the build version of the OS that it should be deployed to. This helps to make sure that your application will run across hosts running different versions of Windows OS. To learn more, see [Specify OS build specific container images](service-fabric-get-started-containers.md#specify-os-build-specific-container-images). 

Microsoft publishes different images for versions of IIS built on different versions of Windows Server. To make sure that Service Fabric deploys a container compatible with the version of Windows Server running on the cluster nodes where it deploys your application, add the following lines to the *ApplicationManifest.xml* file. The build version for Windows Server 2016 is 14393 and the build version for Windows Server version 1709 is 16299. 

```xml
    <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code"> 
      <ImageOverrides> 
        ...
	      <Image Name="microsoft/iis:nanoserverDefault" /> 
          <Image Name= "microsoft/iis:nanoserver" Os="14393" /> 
          <Image Name="microsoft/iis:windowsservercore-1709" Os="16299" /> 
      </ImageOverrides> 
    </ContainerHostPolicies> 
```

The service manifest continues to specify only one image for the nanoserver, `microsoft/iis:nanoserver`. 

## Create a cluster
To deploy the application to a cluster in Azure, you can join a party cluster. Party clusters are free, limited-time Service Fabric clusters hosted on Azure and run by the Service Fabric team where anyone can deploy applications and learn about the platform.  The cluster uses a single self-signed certificate for-node-to node as well as client-to-node security. Party clusters support containers. If you decide to set up and use your own cluster, the cluster must be running on a SKU that supports containers (such as Windows Server 2016 Datacenter with Containers).

Sign in and [join a Windows cluster](http://aka.ms/tryservicefabric). Download the PFX certificate to your computer by clicking the **PFX** link. Click the **How to connect to a secure Party cluster?** link and copy the certificate password. The certificate, certificate password, and the **Connection endpoint** value are used in following steps.

![PFX and connection endpoint](./media/service-fabric-quickstart-containers/party-cluster-cert.png)

> [!Note]
> There are a limited number of Party clusters available per hour. If you get an error when you try to sign up for a Party cluster, you can wait for a period and try again, or you can follow these steps in the [Deploy a .NET app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-tutorial-deploy-app-to-party-cluster#deploy-the-sample-application) tutorial to create a Service Fabric cluster in your Azure subscription and deploy the application to it. The cluster created through Visual Studio supports containers. After you have deployed and verified the application in your cluster, you can skip ahead to [Complete example Service Fabric application and service manifests](#complete-example-service-fabric-application-and-service-manifests) in this quickstart. 
>

On a Windows computer, install the PFX in *CurrentUser\My* certificate store.

```powershell
PS C:\mycertificates> Import-PfxCertificate -FilePath .\party-cluster-873689604-client-cert.pfx -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString 873689604 -AsPlainText -Force)


  PSParentPath: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::CurrentUser\My

``` 

## Deploy the application to Azure using Visual Studio
Now that the application is ready, you can deploy it to a cluster directly from Visual Studio.

Right-click **MyFirstContainer** in the Solution Explorer and choose **Publish**. The Publish dialog appears.

Copy the **Connection Endpoint** from the Party cluster page into the **Connection Endpoint** field. For example, `zwin7fh14scd.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000`. 

Click **Publish**.

Each application in the cluster must have a unique name.  Party clusters are a public, shared environment however and there may be a conflict with an existing application.  If there is a name conflict, rename the Visual Studio project and deploy again.

Open a browser and navigate to the **Connection endpoint** specified in the Party cluster page. You can optionally prepend the scheme identifier, `http://`, and append the port, `:80`, to the URL. For example, http://zwin7fh14scd.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:80. You should see the IIS default web page:

## Next steps
In this quickstart, you learned how to:

* Package a Docker image container
* Configure communication
* Build and package the Service Fabric application
* Deploy the container application to Azure
