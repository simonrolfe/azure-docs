## Register your application
You can register your application in either of two ways.

### Option 1: Express mode
You can quickly register your application by doing the following:
1. Go to the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/portal/register-app?appType=mobileAndDesktopApp&appTech=windowsDesktop&step=configure).

2. Select **Add an app**.

3. In the **Application Name** box, enter a name for your application.

4. Ensure that the **Guided Setup** check box is selected, and then select **Create**.

5. Follow the instructions for obtaining the application ID, and paste it into your code.

### Option 2: Advanced mode
To register your application and add your application registration information to your solution, do the following:
1. If you haven't already registered your application, go to the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/portal/register-app).

2. Select **Add an app**.

3. In the **Application Name** box, enter a name for your application. 

4. Ensure that the **Guided Setup** check box is cleared, and then select **Create**.

5. Select **Add Platform**, select **Native Application**, and then select **Save**.

6. In the **Application ID** box, copy the GUID.

7. Go to Visual Studio, open the *App.xaml.cs* file, and then replace `your_client_id_here` with the application ID that you just registered and copied.

    ```csharp
    private static string ClientId = "your_application_id_here";
    ```
