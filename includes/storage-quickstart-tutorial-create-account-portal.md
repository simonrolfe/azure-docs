## Create a storage account by using the Azure portal

First, create a new general-purpose storage account to use for this quickstart. 

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StorageAccount-ARM) and sign in by using your Azure account. 
2. Enter a unique name for your storage account. Keep these rules in mind for naming your storage account:
    - The name must be 3 to 24 characters in length.
    - The name can contain numbers and lowercase letters only.
4. Select your subscription. 
5. Create a new **Resource group** and give it a unique name. 
6. Select the **Location** to use for your storage account.
7. Leave other fields set to their default values.
8. Select **Pin to dashboard** and select **Create** to create your storage account. 

After your storage account is created, it's pinned to the dashboard of the Azure portal. Select the storage account to open it. Under **Settings**, select **Access keys**. Select the primary account access key and click the **Copy** button to copy the associated connection string to the clipboard. Then paste the string into a text editor for later use.
