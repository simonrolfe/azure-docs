> Your storage account key is similar to the root password for your storage account. Always be careful to protect your account key. Avoid distributing it to other users, hard-coding it, or saving it anywhere in plaintext that is accessible to others. Regenerate your account key using the Azure portal if you believe it may have been compromised. To learn how to regenerate your account key, see [How to create, manage, or delete a storage account in the Azure portal](../articles/storage/common/storage-create-storage-account.md#manage-your-storage-account).
