Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group?view=azure-cli-latest#az_group_create) command.

[!INCLUDE [resource group intro text](resource-group.md)]

The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *westeurope* location.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westeurope
```

To see the available locations, run the `az appservice list-locations` command. You generally create resources in a region near you.
